2.27.0 (2025-04-28)
-----------------------------
* Window dialog & DPI scaling
  - Add "window_color_theme" option in global user config, which sets color theme for main window and dialog. Default theme is "Dark". This option does not affect overlay widget.
    Color theme can be quickly toggled via "UI" button on main window status bar.
  - Add "enable_high_dpi_scaling" option in global user config, which enables window dialog and overlay widget auto-scaling under high DPI screen resolution. This option is disabled by default.
    High DPI scaling mode can be quickly toggled via "Scale" button on main window status bar.
    On Windows, scaling is determined by percentage value set in "Display" > "Scale and Layout" in windows setting.
    For example, "200%" scale in windows setting will double the size of main window dialog and also every widget.
    On Linux, DPI scaling may already be forced "ON" in some system, which this option may not have effect.
  - Fixed broken main window dialog view under high DPI screen resolution. Main window dialog font & elements now scale relatively with system DPI scaling setting.
    Note, while TinyPedal is running, changing screen DPI scaling may still break main window dialog view, and requires restarting TinyPedal to scale correctly according to new DPI scaling setting.
    Alternatively, enable the new "enable_high_dpi_scaling" option to allow auto-scaling window dialog while TinyPedal is running.

* Linux
  - Add "enable_x11_platform_plugin_override" option in "Compatibility", which sets Qt platform plugin type to "X11" via environment variable on Linux. (thanks to @berarma & @SynthetikzZ for Linux assistance)
    This option may help work around some issues with overlay dragging and position on "Wayland". This option requires restarting TinyPedal to take effect. This option is enabled by default on Linux.
  - Fixed missing end slash "/" from global config path that saved global config files in wrong folder.
    For existing Linux user, manual correction is required.
    In "home/username/.config/" folder, find following files and rename:
    "TinyPedalconfig.json" to "config.json"
    "TinyPedalconfig.lock" to "config.lock"
    "TinyPedaldriver.stats" to "driver.stats"
    "TinyPedalpid.log" to "pid.log"
    Then move those files back to "home/username/.config/TinyPedal/" folder.

* Cruise Widget
  - Now reads "scaled track clock time" ("LMU" only) from Rest API if available, which allows synchronizing track clock time and time scale in both singleplayer and multiplayer in "LMU".
  - Add "show_time_scale" option, which shows current session track clock time scale multiplier.

* Misc
  - Add "Restart TinyPedal" to "Window" menu for quickly restarting the APP.
  - Heatmap Editor now shows temperature entries in table view, and supports multi-selection for offsetting and removing temperature, and up to one decimal place is kept.
  - Show "Preset Locked" notification on main window if currently loaded preset is locked.
  - Add new command line arguments "-p, --pyside" for choosing PySide (Qt for Python) module version.
    Currently, this option is only available while "running from source", and mainly for testing purpose or used on platform where PySide2 is no longer available.
  - Fixed a visual problem where fuel level bar indicator does not update remaining level if fuel delta data was not yet recorded for current track.
  - Added new contributor "SynthetikzZ" to contributors.md.

2.26.0 (2025-04-02)
-----------------------------
* Radar Widget
  - Add "show_overlap_indicator_in_cone_style" option (optional), which shows overlap indicator in "cone style" instead of "boundary style".
  - Add "overlap_cone_angle" option, which sets cone display angle in degrees. This option does not affect overlap detection range.
  - Renamed "overlap_detection_range_multiplier" option to "overlap_nearby_range_multiplier", which sets nearby vehicle overlap detection range multiplier.
    A value of "5" would result a 5-vehicle-wide detection range. Default is "5" vehicle-wide.
  - Add "overlap_critical_range_multiplier" option, which sets nearby vehicle critical overlap detection range multiplier. Default is "1" vehicle-wide.
  - Add "show_angle_mark" and angle mark style options, which show angle mark (fixed 45 degrees) on radar background.
  - Fixed radar circle background that was incorrectly displayed on top of overlap indicators.

* Relative, Rivals, Standings Widget
  - Add "show_delta_laptime" option for Rivals & Standings Widget (requested by user "oljemace"), which shows lap time difference (delta) between player and opponents from most recent laps.
    A green color (default) delta indicates that player's recent lap time is faster than opponent, while orange color delta indicates the opposite.
    Number of delta lap time display can be set with "number_of_delta_laptime" option, minimum number is limited to 2, maximum is limited to 5.
    The default layout order shows delta lap time records from right side column (most recent lap) to left. Enable "show_inverted_delta_laptime_layout" option to invert the layout.
  - Add "show_position_change" option (requested by user "bongio94"), which shows overall driver position change relative to overall qualification position.
  - Add "show_position_change_in_class" option, which shows driver position change in class instead of overall. This option is enabled by default.
  - Add "time_gap_align_center" option for Relative Widget.
  - Add "time_interval_align_center" option for Rivals Widget.

* User Preset
  - Add "Lock Preset" and "Unlock Preset" toggle to "right-click" menu in "Preset" tab, which allows locking or unlocking user preset file.
    Any changes made to locked preset will still take effect, but will not be saved to file. APP "version" tag will be attached to the preset that is locked with.
    This feature can be useful for keeping preset unchanged while testing new updates or features.
    Note, this "lock" feature only prevents any changes that made through this APP from saving to locked preset file.
    It does not prevent user from modifying or deleting locked preset file by other means.
  - Add "file lock" config file (config.lock) that saves in "global user configuration" folder, which keeps a list of locked file names.

* Misc
  - Fixed an issue where changes from "Units" and "Global Font Override" dialogs would not take effect after clicked "Apply" more than once.
  - Fixed a rare glitch where widget could be dragged around while "Lock Overlay" is enabled.
  - Various optimization to widgets, modules and save system.
  - Added new contributor "Andres (Corti)" to contributors.md.

2.25.1 (2025-03-18)
-----------------------------
* Important Fix
  - Fixed an issue where all driver stats could be completely reset if driver.stats file could not be accessed while saving.
    Stats file saving now uses "maximum_saving_attempts" value in "Application" setting for saving retries, and backup accordingly.
  - Fixed a rare case where extremely small fuel tank capacity would break fuel calculation,
    such as 1 liter or less tank capacity found on some unusual vehicle mods in "RF2".

* Fuel Module
  - Now supports and auto-detects "battery charge usage" as a primary consumption type with charge regeneration taken into
    calculation for non-hybrid pure electric vehicles such as "FE Gen3" that is based on "RF2" new electric motor system.
    Note, some electric vehicles in "RF2" are based on older electric system and not utilizing the new battery charge
    and electric motor system, such as "FE Gen1" & "FE Gen2".

* Hybrid Module
  - Add estimated battery charge net change (gain or loss) per lap and delta calculation.
  - Add "minimum_delta_distance" option, which sets minimum recording distance (in meters) between each delta sample.
  - Add alternative electric motor state checker for electric vehicle that doesn't have motor state available.
    Battery usage and state info can now be correctly displayed in "Battery, Gear, P2P" Widget for electric vehicles
    that are based on "RF2" new electric motor system but don't have motor state available.

* Battery Widget
  - Add "show_estimated_net_change" option, which shows estimated battery charge net change from current lap.
    Positive value indicates net gain (regen higher than drain); negative indicates net loss (drain higher than regen).
    Total net change reading is more accurate for vehicles that constantly consume battery charge, such as "FE" or "Hypercar" class.
    It is less useful for vehicles that only utilize electric motor for a short duration, such as "P2P".
    Note, at least one full lap (excludes pit-out or first lap) is required to generate estimated net change data.

* Brake temperature, Tyre carcass, Tyre inner layer, Tyre temperature Widget
  - Show unavailable sign as "-" if temperature drops below -100 degrees Celsius.

* Fuel Widget
  - Show "battery usage" (in percentage) data instead of fuel usage for non-hybrid pure electric vehicles.
    Note, since multiple different electric systems exist in "RF2", there is no reliable way to distinguish pure
    electric vehicles from fuel or hybrid vehicles, it is important to make sure "fuel_unit" option in "Units" setting
    is set to "Liter" in order to correctly display battery charge usage in "percentage" for pure electric vehicles.
  - Fixed an issue where "starting fuel level" indicator would sometimes incorrectly reset its position.

* Misc
  - Various small code optimization, further reduced memory usage.
  - Renamed "Units and symbols" to "Units" in config dialog and user guide.
  - Improved user guide navigation.

2.25.0 (2025-03-09)
-----------------------------
* General
  - Show "state overriding" notification on API status bar while "enable_active_state_override" option is enabled.

  - Replaced all "Set" buttons in "Pace Notes Playback" tab with a single "Apply" button for applying changes.
  - Fixed an error in "Spectate Mode" if player index is set lower than "-1" in "Shared Memory API" config.
  - Removed unnecessary "wheel radius info" options from Wheels Module.
  - Optimized copy access mode with Shared Memory API.

* Overlay
  - Add "VR Compatibility" toggle to Overlay & tray menu (implemented by TiberiuC39), which enables widget visibility
    as windows on taskbar in order to be used in VR via APPs such as "OpenKneeboard". Non-VR user should not enable this option.

* [New]Driver Stats (user data)
  - Add new "driver stats" user data file (driver.stats) that saves in "global user configuration" folder.

* [New]Driver Stats Viewer
  - Add "Driver stats viewer" to "Tools" menu in main window for viewing "Driver stats".
    Note, the viewer only allows limited reset or removal, stat value cannot be edited by design.
    Any changes will take immediate effect after confirmation, changes cannot be undone.
    See "Driver stats viewer" section in User Guide for complete usage.

* [New]Stats Module
  - Add "Stats Module" for recording driver stats data. Note, driver stats will not be recorded while spectate mode is enabled.
    See "Stats module" section in User Guide for configuration details.
  - Now outputs "meters driven" data for odometer display in Cruise Widget.

* [New]Consumption History (user data)
  - Add new consumption history user data file (.consumption extension) that saves in "deltabest" folder (default),
    which stores lap time and fuel consumption data per "track and vehicle class", and can be loaded in Fuel Calculator.
    Up to 100 most recent lap entries are saved per "track and vehicle class". Data recording is handled by "Fuel Module".
  - Add "Consumption History" to "Reset Data" menu.

* Fuel Calculator
  - Add "Load Live" button, which loads or updates data from live session to history table.
  - Add "Load File" button, which loads data from consumption history file to history table.
  - Show loaded data source and track and class name on status bar.
  - Add "Tank" column, which shows fuel tank capacity for specific vehicle of the same class
    and can be selected and added to calculation panel.

* [New]Brakes Preset
  - Add new "brakes.json" preset file in "settings" folder, which is used for customizing
    brake failure thickness ("LMU" only) and heatmap style that matches specific vehicle class.
  - Add default brake failure thickness and heatmap style for all vehicle classes currently found in "LMU".
  - Automatically adds missing brake styles found from all running vehicle class to "brakes.json".
  - "brakes" file name is now reserved for "brakes.json" preset.

* [New]Brake Editor
  - Add "Brake Editor" to "Tools" menu in main window, which allows customizing "brakes.json" preset.
    See User Guide "Brake Editor" section for complete usage.

* Brake temperature Widget

    for specific brakes defined in "brakes.json" preset.
    This option applies matching heatmap style to front and rear brakes separately.
    While this option is enabled, "heatmap_name" option has no effect. This option is enabled by default.

* Brake wear Widget
  - Now loads brake "failure thickness" values from "brakes.json" preset for brake wear calculation.
  - Removed old "front_brake_failure_thickness" and "rear_brake_failure_thickness" options.

* Deltabest, Deltabest extended Widget
  - Add "decimal_places" option (requested by Oblit0r). Default is "3" decimal places. Minimum is limited to "1".

* Trailing Widget
  - Add "show_absolute_ffb" option, which converts force feedback value to absolute value before plotting.
    Disable this option to show force feedback plot in both positive and negative range.

* Misc
  - Moved all tools and editors guide into "Tools" section in User Guide. Added internal links for quick accessing related info.
  - Added new contributor "TiberiuC39" to contributors.md.
  - Added "rFactor 2 Community" to "Special Thanks" list in contributors.md.

-----------------------------
* General
  - Add log info for showing various style presets loading status.
  - Unified preset backup file name format.
  - Add preset file validation for "classes.json" and "compounds.json".
  - Removed "tyre_compound_symbol" option from "units" config.

* [New]Compounds Preset
  - Add new "compounds.json" preset file in "settings" folder, which is used for displaying custom
    tyre compound symbol and heatmap style that matches specific tyre compounds.
  - Add default tyre compound styles for all tyres currently found in "LMU".
  - Add default tyre compound styles for some popular vehicles found in "RF2".
  - Add tyre compounds auto-detection system, which automatically adds missing tyre compounds found
    from all running vehicles to "compounds.json" and assigns closest matched compound symbols.
    A "?" symbol will be displayed if a compound name is not commonly known.
  - "compounds" file name is now reserved for "compounds.json" preset.

* [New]Tyre Compound Editor
  - Add "Tyre Compound Editor" to "Tools" menu in main window, which allows customizing "compounds.json" preset.
    See User Guide "Compounds preset" section for complete usage.

* Classes Preset
  - Extended classes preset structure to support more customization in future.
    The new structure now saves alternative "class name" under "alias" key, and "class color" under "color" key.
  - Old "classes.json" file will be auto-updated to this newer structure,
    and a "classes.json.old" backup file will be created in "settings" folder.

* Vehicle Class Editor
  - Now shows customizable classes styles in table view, including "Class name", "Alias name", "Color" columns.
  - Now supports multi-selection for deleting multiple classes.
  - Now supports classes sorting.

* Delta, Energy, Fuel Module
  - Add "minimum_delta_distance" option, which sets minimum recording distance (in meters) between each delta sample.
    Lower value may result more samples recorded and bigger file size; higher value may result less samples recorded and inaccuracy.
    Default value is "5" meters. Recommended value range in "5" to "10" meters.
  - Improved calculation and significantly reduced data fluctuation.

* Relative, Rivals, Standings Widget
  - Now shows tyre compound symbols (front and rear) that matches specific tyre compounds defined in "compounds.json" preset.

* Tyre carcass, Tyre inner layer, Tyre temperature Widget
  - Add "enable_heatmap_auto_matching" option, which enables automatically heatmap style matching
    for specific tyre compounds defined in "compounds.json" preset.
    This option applies matching heatmap style to front and rear tyre compounds separately.
    While this option is enabled, "heatmap_name" option has no effect. This option is enabled by default.
    Note, separate compounds info for tyres on the same axle is not available from game API,
    which currently it is not possible to show left and right compounds separately.
  - Now shows tyre compound symbols (front and rear) that matches specific tyre compounds defined in "compounds.json" preset.

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide info for related changes above.

2.23.0 (2025-01-15)
-----------------------------
* General
  - Add "Remember Size" option in main window Config menu, which remembers last window size.
    This option is enabled by default.
  - Apply laptime pace margin after laptime pace calculation instead of before.

* Relative Widget
  - Add "show_highlighted_nearest_time_gap" option (requested by Jonathan07),
    which highlights opponents within nearest time gap threshold.
  - Add "nearest_time_gap_threshold_*" options for customizing nearest time gap threshold (in seconds).
    Default is "1" second for front, and "2" seconds for behind.
  - Add "show_time_gap_sign" option, "-" indicates opponent's relative position is in front of player,
    "+" indicates the opposite. This option is disabled by default.
  - "show_lap_difference" option no longer applies to "time gap" column to avoid confusion with
    "show_highlighted_nearest_time_gap".

* Track map Widget
  - Add "show_pitout_prediction" option (requested by David levis & Marcelo Prestes),
    which shows estimated pit out on-track position indication for each pit stop duration.
    Note, pit out position prediction is based on "delta best" data which scaled with player's latest
    "lap time pace" for accurate real-time position prediction under various track conditions.
    Pit out prediction requires both valid "track map" and "delta best" data to display.
    At least "one valid lap" for any car and track combo is required to display pit out prediction.
    For accurate prediction, the location of "pit out line" must be found first.
    And since each track has different pit out line location,
    it is required to "pit out" at least "once per session" to mark the correct pit out line location.
    This can be easily done by driving out of pit lane.
  - Add "number_of_predication" option that sets number of pit out predication to display.
    Value range is limited in "1" to "20".
  - Add "pitstop_duration_minimum" option that sets pit stop duration (in seconds) of first predication.
  - Add "pitstop_duration_increment" option that sets each pit stop duration (in seconds) increment
    after previous predication. Default increment is "10" seconds.
    Note, each time when pit stop duration of the nearest predication exceeded current pit stop timer,
    the predication circle will be removed, and a new predication circle will be appended
    with pit stop duration increment after the last predication.
  - Add "pitout_time_offset" option that sets amount time offset (in seconds) for catching up with
    vehicle speed after pit out. Default is "3" seconds.
    Note, this value is important for accurate prediction, as initial vehicle speed is much slower after pit out,
    so extra time is needed for driver to catch up, and also affected by pit out line location.
    For most tracks, this extra time after pit out is roughly within "1" to "5" seconds,
  - Add "show_pitstop_duration" option that shows pit stop duration reading on top of each predication circle.
  - Add "show_position_in_class" option, which shows position in class while "enable_multi_class_styling"
    is also enabled, otherwise this option has no effect.
    While "enable_multi_class_styling" is enabled, disable this option to show overall standings with
    multi-class color (requested by Lazaros Filippakos).

* Misc
  - Updated "Application", "Relative", "Track map" sections in User Guide.

2.22.0 (2024-12-26)
-----------------------------
* General
  - Auto corrects duplicated "column_index" values in widget options to avoid display overlapping.
  - Various code optimization.

* Brake bias Widget
  - Add "show_baseline_bias_delta" option, which shows delta between current and baseline brake bias.
    This can be useful for keeping track of brake bias changes easier during a long race.
    Baseline brake bias is automatically set (and reset) while vehicle is stationary in pit lane.

* Fuel Widget
  - Add "show_absolute_refueling" option (requested by barrett & francescodg), which shows absolute refueling value
    instead of relative refueling when enabled.
    Note, "+" or "-" sign is not displayed with absolute refueling.
    Differences between relative and absolute refueling:
    - Relative refueling value shows total amount "additional" fuel required to finish the remaining race length,
      which matches "relative refueling" mechanism (amount to add on top of remaining fuel in tank) in "RF2".
    - Absolute refueling value shows absolute total amount fuel required to finish the remaining race length,
      which matches "absolute refueling" mechanism (amount total fuel to fill tank up to) in "LMU".
    - Also see "estimated laps" display option in "Session Widget" that can be used for "absolute refueling".
  - Add "caption_text_absolute_refuel" option that shows absolute refueling caption text if
    "show_absolute_refueling" option is enabled. This helps distinguish difference from relative refueling.
    Default caption text is "abfuel".
  - Exchanged column positions of "end" and "pits" for consistency and readability.
    "pits" column is now in the same column as "early".

* Instrument Widget
  - Add "stalling_rpm_threshold" option, which sets RPM threshold for triggering engine stalling warning.
    Default is "100" RPM.
  - Renamed "warning_color_ignition" option to "warning_color_stalling".

* Pace notes, Track notes Widget
  - Fixed notes not showing up if game was paused and unpaused again while on track.

* Relative finish order Widget
  - Add "show_absolute_refilling" option.

* Relative, Rivals, Standings Widget
  - Add "number of penalties" display in "pit stop count" column.
    When a driver accumulates one or more penalties, this column will show the number of penalties
    in negative value with purple (default) background to distinguish from number of pit stops.

* Session Widget
  - Add "show_estimated_laps" option, which shows estimated total remaining laps (from current lap position
    towards finish line) based on total remaining session time and local player's lap time pace.
    This value can be used for adjusting absolute refueling. No value will be shown if session is not time-based.
    Note, this is the same value that used for calculating estimated refueling value in Fuel Module.
    As with estimation, there may be a margin of error of one lap, and may be affected
    by other variables such as those mentioned in "Relative finish order" widget.

* [New]Slip ratio Widget
  - Show visualized slip ratio of each tyre with customizable optimal and critical range and color indication.

* Track map Widget
  - Add "enable_multi_class_styling" option (requested by AndreT990 & Marcelo Prestes), which shows vehicles in
    multi-class color styles on map along with position-in-class standings.
    Multi-class color can be customized from Vehicle Class Editor.
    Random color will be shown if vehicle class is not defined in Vehicle Class Editor.
    Note, while multi-class styling is enabled, following color styles will not be displayed:
    "vehicle_color_player", "vehicle_color_leader", "vehicle_color_same_lap", "vehicle_color_laps_ahead", "vehicle_color_laps_behind".
  - Add "font_color_player", "vehicle_outline_player_color", "vehicle_outline_player_width" options for
    customizing player vehicle style.

* Virtual Energy Widget
  - Add "show_absolute_refilling", "caption_text_absolute_refill" options.
  - Exchanged column positions of "end" and "pits".

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide info for related changes above.

    Note, "Notes Module" must be enabled to allow pace notes playback.
    Disabling this option does not affect "Notes Module" or "Pace notes Widget".
  - By default, pace notes file is automatically loaded from "pace_notes_path" if a file that
    matches current track name is found.
    Enable "Manually Select Pace Notes File" check box to disable auto-file-name matching,
    and manually select a pace notes file that can be played on any track.
    This option takes immediate effect when changed.
  - "Sound file path" sets path for loading pace notes sound files that matches value from
    "pace note" column found in pace notes file. If no sound file found, sound won't be played.
    This option takes immediate effect when changed.

    Pace Notes playback control panel, Pace notes Widget, Track notes Widget.
    Note, this module requires Delta Module enabled to function correctly.

* Wheels Module
  - Add cornering radius calculation.
  - Add "cornering_radius_sampling_interval" option, which sets position sampling interval
    for cornering radius calculation.
    Value range in "5" to "100". Default sampling interval is "10", which is roughly 200ms
    interval between each recorded position. Higher value may result inaccuracy.
    Note, this option does not affect position recording interval.

* Cruise Widget
  - Add "show_distance_into_lap" option which shows distance into current lap.

2.19.1 (2024-10-18)
-----------------------------
* Brake wear Widget
  - Separated "front_brake_failure_thickness, rear_brake_failure_thickness" options
    for front and rear brakes.
    Front brake failure thickness threshold can be different from rear brake.
  - Some reference brake failure thickness threshold:
    Hypercar and P2 classes in LMU usually have 25mm brake failure threshold.
    GTE class in LMU usually has 30mm brake failure threshold.

* Cruise Widget
  - Add "enable_track_clock_synchronization" option, which enables auto track clock
    and time scale synchronization. RestAPI module must be enabled to synchronize
    track clock from Rest API. This option is enabled by default.
    Disable this option to manually set and use "track_clock_time_scale" option for
    track clock display.

2.19.0 (2024-10-15)
-----------------------------
* RestAPI Module
  - Read "brake wear" data from LMU Rest API.

* [New]Brake wear Widget
  - Show brake wear data in percentage or millimeter thickness.
    Important note:
    Brake wear data is currently only available on LMU.
    RF2 currently doesn't provide brake wear data.
    Depends on vehicle, brake may or may not have noticeable wear.
    Additional note:
    Brake maximum thickness (for percentage wear calculation) is retrieved at the moment
    when car leaves garage or has brake repaired or changed.
    Reloading a preset or restarting APP in the middle of a running stint could result
    wrong maximum thickness and percentage wear calculation, which should be avoided.
    "Brake failure thickness" note:
    This option manually sets millimeter thickness threshold at brake failure, which
    affects brake thickness readings and overall brake wear calculation.
    For example, if brake thickness is 40mm, and brake failure thickness is 25mm,
    then effective thickness is 40 - 25 = 15mm.
    Note, brake failure thickness threshold data is not available from game API,
    it may require testing to find out, and may vary from vehicle to vehicle.
    Thickness threshold value should not exceed brake maximum thickness, otherwise
    brake wear readings will not be displayed correctly.
  - Show total brake wear difference of previous lap.
  - Show live brake wear difference of current lap that constantly updated.
  - Show estimated brake lifespan in laps.
  - Show estimated brake lifespan in minutes.
  - Customizable wear warning threshold.

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide info for Brake wear Widget.

* RestAPI Module
  - Read "body aero" and "suspension damage" data from LMU Rest API.

* [Reworked]Damage Widget
  - Add "show_last_impact_cone" option that shows cone indicator towards last known impact position.
    This option can be useful to determine whether there was a collision, even if car was not damaged.
    Cone indicator display duration can be customized by "last_impact_cone_duration" option.
    Default display duration for last known impact is 15 seconds.
    Cone angle (size) can be customized by "last_impact_cone_angle" option.
  - Add "show_aero_integrity_if_available" option that shows body aero integrity reading
    (only available for LMU) instead of bodywork integrity, which better reflects
    severity of bodywork damage that would affect performance.
  - Add suspension damage color indication (only available for LMU) for each wheel, which
    better reflects severity of suspension damage that would affect handling.
    There are now 6 damage levels for each wheel:
    1. No damage to suspension or wheel (default color: green).
    2. Light suspension damage (default damage range: 2% - 15%, default color: yellow).
    3. Medium suspension damage (default damage range: 15% - 40%, default color: orange).
    4. Heavy suspension damage (default damage range: 40% - 80%, default color: purple).
    5. Totaled suspension (default damage range: 80% - 100%, default color: blue).
    6. Wheel detached (default color: black).
  - Add "suspension_damage_*_threshold" options for customizing damage level range.
  - Add a new set of "suspension_color_damage_*" options.
  - Add "wheel_width, wheel_height" options for customizing wheel display size.
    Removed body parts horizontal size restriction.
    Size of body parts and wheels can now be customized freely.
  - Adjusted default "update_interval" value from "20" to "100", as frequent refreshing is
    unnecessary for this widget. Existing setting won't be affected.

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide info for Damage Widget.

  - Optimized DRS status check.

2.18.0 (2024-09-26)
-----------------------------
* General
  - Add global user config file as "config.json", which stores global user settings
    that are independent from user presets.
    For Windows, "config.json" is stored under "username\AppData\Roaming\TinyPedal" folder.
    For Linux, "config.json" is stored under "home/username/.config/TinyPedal" folder.
  - Log files are now stored in the same folder as global user config file.
  - All "Application" and "Compatibility" settings are moved into "config.json".
  - All Config dialogs now shows preset file name on title bar.
  - Color pick dialog now shows up to 16 previously picked colors in "Custom colors" selector.
  - Smaller panel size for "Fuel Calculator".
  - Most of widgets & modules code has been rewritten and optimized for improved efficiency
    and less CPU and memory usage.
    Note, currently both "Friction Circle" & "Navigation" Widgets are known to consume more
    CPU usage for drawing complex plot and animated map, especially with "Navigation" Widget
    and a lot of vehicles on track. If there is significant increase in APP 's CPU usage,
    try disable either widgets, which should help lower CPU usage to normal level.
    The new "System performance Widget" (see below) can be used to monitor performance change.

* [New]Application dialog
  - Add "Application" to main window "Config" menu for customizing global application settings
    and saved in global user config file.
  - "grid_move_size, minimum_update_interval, maximum_saving_attempts" options from
    "compatibility" are moved to "application".
  - Add "show_confirmation_for_batch_toggle" option, which shows confirmation dialog
    for enabling or disabling all widgets or modules. This option is enabled by default.

* [New]User path dialog
  - Add "User path" to main window "Config" menu for customizing global user path settings
    and saved in global user config file.
    To change user path, double-clicking on edit box to open "Select folder" dialog;
    or manually editing path text.
    Click "Apply" or "Save" to verify and apply new paths. Invalid path will not be applied.
  - For linux, all default user config-type paths are now set according to XDG specification,
    which is located under "home/username/.config" folder. (thanks to feedback from Bernat)
    Changes include:
    * Default "user preset" path is changed to "home/username/.config/TinyPedal/settings/",
      previously this was set in "home/username/.config/TinyPedal/".
    * Default "brandlogo" path is changed to "home/username/.config/TinyPedal/brandlogo/",
      previously this was set in "home/username/.local/share/TinyPedal/brandlogo/".
    Note, if you wish to keep using old paths on linux, you can use "User path dialog"
    to set paths to the old ones as mentioned above.
  - See User Guide "User path" section for additional info.

* [New]Auto load preset system
  - Add "Auto load preset" system (implemented by naturale0) to allow auto loading user-defined
    game-specific preset depends on active game (currently supports RF2 and LMU).
    Auto loading preset is triggered when a new or different game is started & active.
    Auto loading will only trigger once per game change.
    A preset must be tagged as "primary" for specific game before it can be auto loaded.
    This option is disabled by default.
  - Add "Auto load primary preset" check box in "Preset" tab, which enables or disables
    "Auto load preset" system.
  - Add "primary preset" tagging function in "Preset" tab, user can "Right" click on a preset
    and select "Set primary for ***" to tag a preset as "primary" for specific game.
    To clear all tags from selected preset, "Right" click and select "Clear primary tag".
    Primary preset will be auto loaded when "Auto load primary preset" is enabled and
    a new or different game is started & active.
    Note, a single preset can have tags from multiple games.

* Shared Memory API
  - Improved accessing efficiency, now uses fast-restart method for same API.
  - Significantly reduced opponents vehicle position desync issue when using "direct access" mode
    (as previously was noticeable on Radar Widget sometimes).

* Vehicle Brand Editor
  - Now allows multi-selection for deleting vehicle brand entries.
  - Fixed some vehicle info that could not be imported from LMU Rest API (issue reported by DanRZ).
    Make sure to use "import" again from Vehicle Brand Editor to update missing vehicle info from LMU.

* Wheels module
  - Add differential locking calculation and output for the new Differential Widget.
  - Add "minimum_axle_rotation" option, which sets minimum axle rotation (radians per second)
    for calculating wheel radius and differential locking percent.
    Default value is "4".
  - Add "maximum_rotation_difference_*" options, which set maximum rotation difference (percentage)
    between left or right wheel and same axle for limiting wheel radius calculation.
    Setting higher difference value may result inaccurate wheel radius reading.
    Default value is "0.002".

* Brake bias Widget
  - Add "layout" option, which sets display orientation.
    Default is horizontal. Set "0" to show vertically.

* Cruise Widget
  - Add "layout" option, which sets display orientation.
    Default is horizontal. Set "0" to show vertically.
  - Add "odometer_maximum_digits" option, which sets maximum number of display digits.

* [New]Differential Widget
  - Show minimum differential locking percent between left and right wheels on the same axle
    under power (on throttle) or coasting (off throttle).
    A "100%" reading indicates two wheels on the same axle are rotating at same speed;
    while "0%" indicates that one of the wheels is completely spinning or locked.
    Each reading will reset back to "100%" if minimum locking percent hasn't changed during
    cooldown period, as defined by "reset_cooldown" option.

* Instrument Widget
  - Changed default "layout" setting value to "1" for horizontal layout for consistency.
    User may need to edit old value "0" to "1" to display horizontal layout.
  - Wheel slip warning indicator now only shows under acceleration.

* [New]Laps and position Widget
  - Show your current lap number (lap progression) & max laps if available.
  - Show your current overall position against all drivers in a session.
  - Show your current position in class against all drivers from the same class.

* P2P Widget
  - Replaced old "font_color_inactive" and "bkg_color_inactive" color settings with new cooldown
    "font_color_battery_cooldown, bkg_color_battery_cooldown" for battery charge, and
    "font_color_activation_cooldown, bkg_color_activation_cooldown" for activation timer.

* Radar Widget
  - Add "enable_radar_fade" option (feature requested by Jernej Simoncic), which enables
    gradually fade in/out effect while opponent vehicles approach or leave radar range.
  - Add "radar_fade_out_radius" option, which sets radar fade out radius relative to radar radius.
    Value range in "0.5" to "1.0". Default value is "0.98".
  - Add "radar_fade_in_radius" option, which sets radar fade in radius relative to radar radius.
    Minimum value is limited to "0.1", maximum value cannot exceed "radar_fade_out_radius".
    Default value is "0.8".
  - Renamed options "show_fade_out, fade_in_radius, fade_out_radius" to
    "show_edge_fade_out, edge_fade_in_radius, edge_fade_out_radius" to
    distinguish from new radar fade options.

* Relative, Rivals, Standings Widget
  - "show_pit_status" option now also displays garage status (as "G" sign) for driver in garage.
  - Add "garage_status_text" option, which sets custom garage status text for driver in garage.

* Session Widget
  - Removed "lap number" and "driver position" readings. Those two readings are now included in
    the new "Laps and position Widget".
  - Add "layout" option, which sets display orientation.
    Default is horizontal. Set "0" to show vertically.

* Speedometer Widget
  - Changed default "layout" setting value to "1" for horizontal layout for consistency.

* [New]System performance Widget
  - Show system's overall CPU utilization (percent) and memory usage (GB).
  - Show TinyPedal's CPU utilization (percent) and memory usage (MB).

* Tyre carcass temperature Widget
  - Now calculates temperature rate of change at an average base interval of 0.1 seconds
    which is then scaled to "rate_of_change_interval" value for more responsive estimate.
  - Add "rate_of_change_smoothing_samples" option for smoothing data and filter out fluctuation.

* Tyre wear Widget
  - Now uses laptime pace for calculating "tyre lifespan in minutes".

* [Reworked]Weather Widget
  - Add weather trend indication, which shows whether there has been an increasing or
    decreasing trend for temperature, raininess, wetness readings for a given period.
    This can be useful to determine pit stop strategy.
  - Add "temperature_trend_interval", "raininess_trend_interval", "wetness_trend_interval"
    options, which set each trend interval in seconds. Default interval is "60" seconds.
  - Add "prefix_rain", "prefix_dry", "prefix_wet", "font_color_trend_constant",
    "font_color_trend_decreasing", "font_color_trend_increasing" options.
  - Improved display formatting for temperature, raininess, wetness readings.

  - Fixed state check error while restarting API in rare case.
  - Add clickable API button on main window status bar
    that opens "Shared Memory API" config dialog for easy access.

* Fuel calculator
  - Fixed an error when calculating with Gallon unit.

* Relative finish order Widget
  - Add "show_extra_refilling" option, which shows readings of extra refilling row
    below "local player's refilling" row. Each extra refilling value equals "extra laps
    of consumption" plus "local player's refilling" value of same column.
    Those values save the trouble from manual calculation in case there will be extra laps.
    The first column of extra refilling row shows number of extra laps depends on
    "number of extra laps" setting, such as "EX+1" for 1 extra lap, or "EX+3" for 3 extra laps.
  - Add "number_of_extra_laps" option, which sets number of extra laps for extra refilling calculation.
    Default is "1" extra lap.
  - Updated usage and examples for Relative finish order Widget in User Guide.

2.17.3 (2024-08-19)
-----------------------------
* General
  - Fixed a bug (introduced in v2.17.0) in API connector that would cause TinyPedal to stop work
    when user selected "LMU API" in Shared Memory API config dialog.
    Note, LMU API option is currently only a placeholder which uses the same underlying
    RF2 API and "rF2 Shared Memory Plugin" and works exactly same as RF2.
    Updated "User Guide" info regarding API selector.
  - Optimized overlay state check to avoid unnecessary function calls.

* Command line arguments
  - Add "-h, --help" argument, which shows all available command line arguments.
  - Add "-s, --single-instance" argument for toggling single instance mode,
    which allows multiple instances of TinyPedal to be running at same time
    by adding "-s 0" or "--single-instance 0" argument.
    Default is single instance only, which only one TinyPedal may be run at a time.
  - Single instance mode now works under Linux, or running from source script.
  - Add "Single instance mode" info to log output.
  - Add "pid.log" output file in log folder when "Single instance mode" is enabled.
  - See User Guide "Command line arguments" section for details.

* Misc
  - Added new contributor (ebeninca) to contributors.md.

2.17.2 (2024-08-08)
-----------------------------
* Brake bias Widget
  - [New]Add brake migration display, which shows real-time brake migration change,
    as commonly seen in LMH and LMDh classes.
    Note, brake migration is calculated based on brake input and brake pressure
    telemetry data, and is affected by pedal force setting from car setup and
    electric braking allocation of specific vehicle.
    To get accurate brake migration reading, it is necessary for brake pedal
    to reach fully pressed state for at least once while entering track to recalibrate
    brake pressure scaling for brake migration calculation.
    It is normally not required to do manually, as game's auto-hold brake assist is on by default.
    However if auto-hold brake assist is off, or the APP was reloaded while player was already on track,
    then it is required to do a full braking for at least once to get accurate brake migration reading.
  - Add "electric_braking_allocation" option for calculating brake migration
    under different electric braking allocation from specific vehicle.
    Note, vehicle that has not electric braking, or has disabled regeneration, is not affected by this option.
    Incorrect allocation value will result wrong brake migration reading from vehicle that has electric braking activated.
    Set value to "-1" to enable auto-detection, which automatically checks whether electric braking is activated
    on either axles while braking, and sets allocation accordingly.
    This is enabled by default. Note, it may take a few brakes to detect correct allocation.
    Set value to "0" to manual override and use front allocation,
    which is commonly seen in LMH class.
    Set value to "1" to manual override and use rear allocation,
    which is commonly seen in LMDh class.
  - Add "prefix_brake_migration" and "suffix_brake_migration" options for brake migration.
  - Add "column_index" and "decimal_places" options for both brake bias and brake migration.

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide for Brake bias Widget.

2.17.1 (2024-08-04)
-----------------------------
* Fuel energy saver Widget
  - Fixed "minimum_reserve" setting not taking effect.

* Navigation Widget
  - Reworked map path drawing methods which completely eliminated high memory usage issue with this widget.
    Map drawing now uses around 1MB memory for normal tracks,
    and at most 3 or 4MB memory for very large tracks, such as Isle of Man.
    There is also a slightly increase in map display quality.

2.17.0 (2024-08-02)
-----------------------------
* [New]Fuel energy saver Widget
  - Show current stint estimated total completable laps and completed laps
    based on current consumption.
  - Show estimated target lap consumption to save (extend) one or more total
    stint laps, with customizable number of target slots (10 for more, 5 for less).
  - Show delta consumption against target lap consumption, which allows
    fuel or energy saving to be visualized and easily controlled in real-time.
  - Show consumption type in "FUEL" or "NRG" (if virtual energy available).
  - Show last lap consumption.
  - For complete customizable options, usage examples, see User Guide "Fuel energy saver" section.

* Virtual energy Widget
  - Add "delta energy consumption" display (to be in line with Fuel Widget),
    which shows "delta consumption" against last lap energy consumption.
  - Add "fuel bias" display, which shows estimated laps difference between
    fuel and virtual energy.
    Positive value means more laps can be run on fuel than energy;
    in other words, energy is drained faster than fuel.
    General speaking, it is a good idea to keep bias close to 0.0 so that
    fuel and energy drains at same pace, and slightly towards positive side
    to avoid running out of fuel before energy does.
  - Set new default low energy warning color to purple instead of red, which helps
    distinguish from Fuel Widget.
    Existing setting won't be affected, use Config "reset" to set new default.

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide info for Fuel energy saver Widget, Virtual energy Widget.

2.16.0 (2024-07-29)
-----------------------------
* Delta Module
  - Add data smoothing function to filter out unusual data noise.
  - Add "delta_smoothing_samples" option, which sets number of samples
    for delta data smoothing calculation using exponential moving average (EMA) method.
    Value range in "1" to "100". Default is "30" samples. Set to "1" to disable smoothing.
    Higher value results more smoothness, but may lose accuracy.
  - Add average laptime pace calculation and output.
  - Add "laptime_pace_samples" option, which sets number of samples
    for average laptime pace calculation (EMA).
    Value range in "1" to "20". Default is "6" samples. Set to "1" to disable averaging.
    Note, initial laptime pace is always based on player's all time personal best laptime if available.
    If a new laptime is faster than current laptime pace, it will replace
    current laptime pace without calculating average.
    Invalid lap, pit-in/out laps are always excluded from laptime pace calculation.
  - Add "laptime_pace_margin" option, which sets additional margin for current laptime
    that cannot exceed the sum of "laptime pace" and "margin".
    This option is used to minimize the impact of unusually slow laptime.
    Default value is "5" seconds. Minimum value is limited to "0.1".

* Fuel Module
  - Now uses laptime pace value from Delta Module for real-time fuel calculation
    for increased consistency and accuracy.

* Vehicles Module
  - Fixed pit timer incorrectly reset after pit out.

* Flag Widget
  - "Pit Request" indicator now shows "pit-in laps countdown" alongside
    "estimated remaining laps" reading that current fuel or energy can run.
    Note, "pit-in laps countdown" value is always calculated towards
    the finish line of current stint's final lap, and thus is always
    less than or equal to "estimated remaining laps" reading.
    If countdown drops below 1.0 (laps), it indicates the final lap of current stint,
    and driver should pit in before the end of current lap to refuel.
    If countdown reaches zero or negative, there may still be some fuel or energy left in tank,
    however it will not be enough to complete another full lap.

* Friction circle Widget
  - Add "show_trace_fade_out" option, which enables trace fade out effect.
  - Add "trace_fade_out_step" option, which sets trace fade out speed.
    Value range in "0.1" to "0.9", higher value increases trace fade out speed.
    Default value is "0.2". This option is enabled by default.

* [New]Relative finish order Widget
  - New Relative finish order Widget that displays estimated relative finish order
    between leader and local player with corresponding refilling estimate.
    This widget auto-switches display mode ("TIME" or "LAPS") depends on current session type.
  - Show both predefined and customizable "leader's pit time" and "local player's pit time",
    as well as last pit stop time from leader and local player.
  - Show "leader's final lap progress" and "local player's final lap progress"
    that depend on current session type.
  - Show "relative lap difference" between leader and local player that is calculated from
    lap time pace difference of both players, which can be used to determine whether leader
    has the chance to overtake local player on final lap.
  - Show refilling type in "FUEL" or "NRG" (if virtual energy available).
  - Show estimated "local player's refilling" that depends on current session type.
  - For complete customizable options, usage examples, see User Guide "Relative finish order" section.

* Timing Widget
  - Add "show_average_pace" option, which shows personal current average laptime pace,
    this reading is also used in real-time fuel calculation.
    Note, additional "average laptime pace" calculation setting can be found in "Delta Module" config.
    After ESC or session ended, laptime pace reading will be reset,
    and aligned to "all time personal best laptime" if available.

* Weather forecast Widget
  - Add "number_of_forecasts" option, which sets number of forecasts to display.
    Value range in "1" to "4". Default is "4" forecasts.
  - Add "column_index_*" options for customizing data display order of each forecast.

* Misc
  - Updated User Guide info for Delta Module, Flag Widget, Friction circle Widget,
    Relative finish order Widget, Timing Widget, Weather forecast Widget.

2.15.1 (2024-07-13)
-----------------------------
* General
  - Reworked preset saving system to prevent preset file corruption in rare case.
    Saving system now creates temporary backup for old preset file before saving.
    If all saving attempts failed, saving will be aborted,
    and old preset file will be restored to avoid preset file corruption.
  - Add "maximum_saving_attempts" option in Compatibility dialog,
    which sets maximum retry attempts for preset saving.
    Default value is "10". Minimum value is limited to "3" maximum attempts.
    Note, each attempt has a roughly 50ms delay.

* Radar Widget
  - Fixed an issue where radar would not auto hide under certain condition.

* Sectors Widget
  - Fixed incorrect PB sector time display if "target time" is set on "Personal".

* Weather forecast Widget
  - Add "layout" option, which sets columns display order.
    "0" = show columns from left to right.
