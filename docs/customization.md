# Preset management
TinyPedal stores all customization options in `JSON` format preset files, and can be managed from `Preset` tab in main window.

All user preset files, by default, are located in `TinyPedal\settings` folder. Those `JSON` files can also be manually edited with text editor.

`Double-Click` on a preset name in `Preset` tab to load selected preset.

Click `Transfer` button to transfer settings from currently loaded preset to another preset. See [Preset Transfer](#preset-transfer) section for details.

`Right-Click` on a preset name in `Preset` tab opens up a context menu that provides additional preset file management options:

* Lock Preset
    Lock selected preset, which prevents any changes that made through TinyPedal from saving to locked preset file. APP `version` tag will be attached to the preset that is locked with.

    Note, this feature does not prevent user from modifying or deleting locked preset file by other means. Locked preset file info is stored in `config.lock` file in [Global User Configuration](#global-user-configuration) folder.

* Unlock Preset
    Unlock selected preset.

* Set primary for *
    Add `primary sim` tag to selected preset, which will be auto loaded by `Auto load preset` system. Note, a single preset can have tags from multiple games.

* Clear primary tag
    Clear all tags from selected preset.

* Duplicate
    Duplicate selected preset with a new name.

## Saving JSON file
TinyPedal automatically saves setting when user makes changes to widget position, or has toggled widget visibility, auto-hide, overlay-lock, etc. Changes will only take effect after `Reload` preset, or clicked `Save` or `Apply` button in `Config` dialog, or `Restart` APP.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Backup JSON file
TinyPedal will automatically create backup file with time stamp suffix if old setting file fails to load, and new default `JSON` with same filename will be generated.

A newer released version will auto-update old setting and add new setting after loading. It may still be a good idea to manually backup files before upgrading to newer version.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Editing JSON file
Customization can be done through various configuration dialogs and menus from main window. Manual editing `JSON` file is not recommended.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Preset Transfer
**Preset transfer dialog is used for transferring settings from one preset to another.**

Note, you can only transfer settings from a currently loaded preset to another preset, this is done to ensure one-way transfer. A confirmation dialog will be shown before transfer.

It is recommended to first load a preset, then unhide the preset and double-check if you wish to transfer its settings to another preset. For important preset, it is recommended to make a backup copy and lock the preset.

To transfer settings from currently loaded preset to another specific preset, select a preset name from preset selector on the top right. Locked presets are not available from preset selector.

To select one or more settings, select and check setting name from `Setting` list on the left side. Only selected settings will be transferred.

To select one or more option types, select and check option type name from `Option Type` list on the right side. Only selected options will be transferred.

To select or deselect all settings or option types from list, click `All` or `None` button on list header.

Option types:
- Enable State: widget or module enable state.
- Feature Toggle: widget or module feature enable state, such as `enable_XXX` or `show_XXX`.
- Update Interval: widget or module update interval and idle update interval.
- Position: widget position.
- Opacity: widget opacity.
- Layout: widget layout.
- Color: color options.
- Font: font name, font weight, font size options.
- Column Index: column index options.
- Decimal Places: decimal places options.
- Other Options: all other options that are not part of above option types.

For example, to transfer all settings except widget position to another preset, select and check all settings from `setting` list, then select all options except `position` from `option type` list, and click `Transfer` button.

# General options
**General options can be accessed from main window menu.**

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Common terms and keywords
**These are the commonly used setting terms and keywords.**

    enable
Check whether a widget or module will be loaded at startup.

    update_interval
Set refresh rate for widget or module in milliseconds. A value of `20` means refreshing every 20ms, which equals 50fps. Since most data from sharedmemory plugin is capped at 50fps, and most operation system has a roughly 15ms minimum sleep time, setting value less than `10` has no benefit, and extreme low value may result significant increase of CPU usage.

    idle_update_interval
Set refresh rate for module while idling for conserving resources.

    position_x, position_y
Define widget position on screen in pixels. Those values will be auto updated and saved.

    opacity
Set opacity for entire widget. By default, all widgets have a 90% opacity setting, which equals value `0.9`. Lower value adds more transparency to widget. Acceptable value range in `0.0` to `1.0`. Note, opacity can also be set by adjusting alpha value in `color` options for individual elements.

    bar_gap, inner_gap
Set gap (screen pixel) between elements in a widget, only accept integer, `1` = 1 pixel.

    font_name
Mono type font is highly recommended. To set custom font, write `full font name` inside quotation marks. If a font name is invalid, a default fallback font will be used by program.

    font_size
Set font size in pixel, increase or decrease font size will also apply to widget size.

    font_weight
Acceptable value: `normal` or `bold`.

    enable_auto_font_offset
Automatically adjust font vertical offset based on font geometry for better vertical alignment, and should give good result in most case. This option is enabled by default, and only available to certain widgets. Set `false` to disable.

    font_offset_vertical
Manually set font vertical offset. Default is `0`. Negative value will offset font upward, and position value for downward. This option only takes effect when `enable_auto_font_offset` is set to `false`.

    *_offset_x, *_offset_y
Set text offset position (percentage), value range in `0.0` to `1.0`.

    bar_padding
Set widget edge padding value that multiplies and scales with `font_size`. Default is `0.2` for most widgets. Increase padding value will further increase each element width in widget.

    color
Set color in hexadecimal color codes with alpha value (opacity). The color code format starts with `#`, then follows by two-digit hexadecimal numbers for each channel in the order of `alpha`, `red`, `green`, `blue`. Note, `alpha` is optional and can be omitted. User can select a new color without manual editing, by double-clicking on color entry box in `Config` dialog.

    text_alignment
Set text alignment. Acceptable value: `Left`, `Center`, `Right`.

    prefix
Set prefix text that displayed beside corresponding data. Set to `""` to hide prefix text.

    show_caption
Show short caption description on widget.

    column_index
Set order of each info column(or row). Must keep index number unique to each column, otherwise columns may overlap.

    decimal_places
Set amount decimal places to keep.

    remember_position
Remember main window last position.

    remember_size
Remember main window last size.

    enable_high_dpi_scaling
Enable window dialog and overlay widget auto-scaling under high DPI screen resolution. This option requires restarting TinyPedal to take effect. This option is enabled by default.

High DPI scaling mode can be quickly toggled via `Scale` button on main window status bar.

On Windows, scaling is determined by percentage value set in `Display` > `Scale and Layout` setting. For example, `200%` scale in windows setting will double the size of main window dialog and also every widget.

On Linux, DPI scaling may already be forced `ON` in some system, which this option may not have effect.

    enable_auto_load_preset
Enable `Auto load preset` system to allow auto loading user-defined game-specific preset depends on active game (currently supports `RF2` and `LMU`).

Auto loading preset is triggered when a new or different game is started and active. Auto loading will only trigger once per game change. A preset must be tagged as `primary` for specific game before it can be auto loaded. See [Preset Management](#preset-management) section for details.

This option is disabled by default.

    show_confirmation_for_batch_toggle
Show confirmation dialog for enabling or disabling all widgets or modules. This option is enabled by default.

    snap_distance
The distance (in pixels) at which the widget will snap to screen edges or other widgets. Default `10`. Hold `Ctrl` to enable snapping.

    snap_gap
The gap (in pixels) to leave between the widget and the snapped widget edges. Default `0`.

    grid_move_size
Set grid size for grid move, value in pixel. Default is `8` pixel. Minimum value is limited to `1`.

Default value is `10`, and should not be modified.

    maximum_saving_attempts
Set maximum retry attempts for preset saving. Default value is `10`. Minimum value is limited to `3` maximum attempts. Note, each attempt has a roughly 50ms delay. If all saving attempts failed, saving will be aborted, and old preset file will be restored to avoid preset file corruption.

    position_x, position_y
Define main window position on screen in pixels. Those values will be auto updated and saved while `remember_position` option is enabled.

    window_width, window_height
Define main window size on screen in pixels. Those values will be auto updated and saved while `remember_size` option is enabled.

    window_color_theme
Set color theme for main window and dialog. Default theme is `Dark`. This option does not affect overlay widget.

Color theme can be quickly toggled via `UI` button on main window status bar.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Compatibility
**Compatibility options can be accessed from `Config` menu in main window.**

    enable_bypass_window_manager

    global_bkg_color
Sets global background color for all widgets.

Note, global background color will only be visible when `enable_translucent_background` option is disabled or translucent background is not supported. Some widgets with own background setting may override this option.

    multimedia_plugin_on_windows
Set multimedia plugin for playing sound file on windows. Default is using `WMF` plugin.

Note, if the option is set on `DirectShow`, additional audio decoder software may be required to play certain sound formats, such as `MP3`. This option requires restarting TinyPedal to take effect.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## User path
**User path options can be accessed from `Config` menu in main window.**

User path dialog allows customization to global user path for storing different user data.

To change user path, double-clicking on edit box to open `Select folder` dialog; or manually editing path text. Folder will be automatically created if does not exist.

Click `Apply` or `Save` button to verify and apply new paths. Invalid path will not be applied.

**Notes to relative and absolute path**

User path that sets inside TinyPedal root folder will be automatically converted to relative path. Relative path is not considered global path, and does not share data between multiple copies of TinyPedal. This is done to retain portability and compatibility with old version.

To share user path across multiple copies of TinyPedal, user must set path to place outside TinyPedal APP root folder.

**Default user path**

* On windows, all user paths are set inside TinyPedal root folder as relative paths:

        brandlogo/
        deltabest/
        settings/
        trackmap/
        pacenotes/
        tracknotes/

* On Linux, all user paths are set outside TinyPedal root folder as absolute paths:

        home/username/.config/TinyPedal/brandlogo/
        home/username/.config/TinyPedal/settings/
        home/username/.config/TinyPedal/pacenotes/
        home/username/.config/TinyPedal/tracknotes/

**Fuel calculator can be accessed from `Tools` menu in main window.**

Fuel value and unit symbol depend on `Fuel Unit` setting from [Units](#units) config dialog, `L` = liter, `gal` = gallon. Virtual energy unit is `%` = percentage. Note, after changed `Fuel Unit` setting, it is required to close and reopen `Fuel calculator` in order to update units info for calculation.

    Calculation panel
On the left side is calculation panel, which handles `fuel` and `virtual energy` usage calculation and results display.

This panel also includes a vertical `pit stop preview` bar on the left, which visualizes pit stops as blue marks and stint laps as grey marks. Each pit stop mark shows a reference lap completion number. Total estimated number of race laps is displayed at bottom of the bar.

Note, when `Energy consumption` value is higher than zero, pit stops and stint laps from preview bar will be calculated based on energy usage. Stint lap mark may not be displayed if there is not enough space to draw.

    Consumption history table
On the right side is consumption history table, which lists `lap number`, `lap time`, `fuel consumption`, `virtual energy consumption`, `battery drain`, `battery regen`, `average tyre tread wear`, `tank capacity` data from [Consumption History](#consumption-history) data. Invalid lap time or consumption data is highlighted in red.

Click `Load Live` button to load or update consumption history from live session to history table and automatically fill in latest data to calculator.

Click `Load File` button to load data from specific consumption history file to history table and automatically fill in latest data to calculator.

Loaded data source and track and class name will be displayed on status bar.

Select one or more `Time`, `Fuel`, `Energy`, `Tyre`, `Tank` values from history table and click `Add selected data` button to send value to calculator.

Select multiple values from history table and click `Add selected data` button to calculate average reading of selected values and send to calculator.

    Lap time
Set lap time in `minutes` : `seconds` : `milliseconds` format. Values are automatically carried over between spin boxes when exceeded min or max value range. This value can be retrieved from `Time` column.

    Tank capacity
Set vehicle fuel tank capacity. This value can be retrieved from `Tank` column.

    Formation/Rolling
Set number of formation or rolling start laps.

    Average pit seconds
Set average pit stop time in seconds.

    Total race fuel, Total race energy
Show total required fuel or energy to finish race. First value is raw reading with decimal places, second value behind `≈` sign is rounded up integer reading.

    End stint fuel, End stint energy
Show remaining fuel or energy at the end of stint.

    Total pit stops
Show total number of pit stops required to finish race. First value is raw reading with decimal places, second value behind `≈` sign is rounded up integer reading.

Note, sometimes when `Average pit seconds` is set to longer duration, ceiling integer reading may be rounded up `2` units higher than raw reading, this is not an error. For example, it may show `5.978 ≈ 7` instead of `5.978 ≈ 6`, this is because when calculating from `6` pit stops, due to less amount time spent in pit stop compare to `7`, more fuel is required per pit stop which would exceed tank capacity, hence calculator adds 1 more pit stop.

    One less pit stop
Show theoretical fuel or energy consumption in order to make one less pit stop.

    Total laps, Total minutes
Show total laps and minutes can run based on `Total race fuel` or `Total race energy` value.

    Starting fuel, Starting energy
Set amount fuel or energy to carry at the starting of race (first stint). This value affects `Total race fuel (or energy)` and `Total pit stops` calculation, and is used for calculating `Average refueling` or `Average replenishing` per pit stop. Maximum value cannot exceed `Tank capacity` for fuel (or `100%` for energy). If value is set to `0` (default), `Tank capacity` value will be used as starting fuel (or `100%` for starting energy) for `Average refueling` calculation.

    Average refueling, Average replenishing
Show average refueling or replenishing per pit stop, and display warning color if value exceeds `Tank capacity` (fuel) or `100%` (energy).

    Starting tyre tread

## Battery
**This widget displays battery usage info.**

Note, there are some electric vehicles in `RF2` that are not based on the new electric motor and battery charge system, which there is no battery usage info available.

    show_battery_charge
Show percentage available battery charge.

    show_battery_drain
Show percentage battery charge drained in current lap.

    show_battery_regen
Show percentage battery charge regenerated in current lap.

    show_estimated_net_change
Show estimated battery charge net change from current lap. Positive value indicates net gain (regen higher than drain); negative indicates net loss (drain higher than regen).

Total net change reading is more accurate for vehicles that constantly consume battery charge, such as `FE` or `Hypercar` class. It is less useful for vehicles that only utilize electric motor for a short duration, such as `P2P`.

Note, at least one full lap (excludes pit-out or first lap) is required to generate estimated net change data.

    show_activation_timer
Show electric boost motor activation timer.

    high_battery_threshold, low_battery_threshold
Set percentage threshold for displaying low or high battery charge warning indicator. Default high threshold is `95` percent (default color purple), low threshold is `10` percent (default color red).

    freeze_duration
Set freeze duration (seconds) for displaying previous lap total drained/regenerated battery charge after crossing finish line. Value range in `0` to `30` seconds. Default is `10` seconds.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake bias
**This widget displays brake bias info.**

    show_front_and_rear
Show both front and rear bias. Default is `false`.

    show_percentage_sign
Set `true` to show percentage sign for brake bias value.

    show_baseline_bias_delta
Show delta between current and baseline brake bias, which can be useful for keeping track of brake bias changes easier during a long race. Baseline brake bias is automatically set (and reset) while vehicle is stationary in pit lane.

    show_brake_migration
Show real-time brake migration change, as commonly seen in LMH and LMDh classes.

Note, brake migration is calculated based on brake input and brake pressure telemetry data, and is affected by pedal force setting from car setup and electric braking allocation of specific vehicle.

To get accurate brake migration reading, it is necessary for brake pedal to reach fully pressed state for at least once while entering track to recalibrate brake pressure scaling for brake migration calculation. It is normally not required to do manually, as game's auto-hold brake assist is on by default. However if auto-hold brake assist is off, or the APP was reloaded while player was already on track, then it is required to do a full braking for at least once to get accurate brake migration reading.

    electric_braking_allocation
Set allocation for calculating brake migration under different electric braking allocation from specific vehicle. Note, vehicle that has not electric braking, or has disabled regeneration, is not affected by this option. Incorrect allocation value will result wrong brake migration reading from vehicle that has electric braking activated.

Set value to `-1` to enable auto-detection, which automatically checks whether electric braking is activated on either axles while braking, and sets allocation accordingly. This is enabled by default. Note, it may take a few brakes to detect correct allocation.

Set value to `0` to manual override and use front allocation, which is commonly seen in LMH class.

Set value to `1` to manual override and use rear allocation, which is commonly seen in LMDh class.

## Brake pressure
**This widget displays visualized percentage brake pressure info.**

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake temperature
**This widget displays brake temperature info.**

Note, if temperature drops below `-100` degrees Celsius, temperature readings will be replaced by unavailable sign as `-`. This usually indicates brake failure, or brake is not available on one of the wheels.

    layout
2 layouts are available: `0` = vertical layout, `1` = horizontal layout.

    enable_heatmap_auto_matching
Enable automatically heatmap style matching for specific brakes defined in `brakes.json` preset. This option applies matching heatmap style to front and rear brakes separately.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake wear
**This widget displays brake wear info.**

Important note: Brake wear data is currently only available on `LMU`. `RF2` currently doesn't provide brake wear data. Depends on vehicle, brake may or may not have noticeable wear.

    layout
2 layouts are available: `0` = vertical layout, `1` = horizontal layout.

    show_thickness
Show brake thickness (millimeter) instead of percentage, which also affects wear difference readings.

Note, brake maximum thickness (for percentage wear calculation) is retrieved at the moment when car leaves garage or has brake repaired or changed. Reloading a preset or restarting APP in the middle of a running stint could result wrong maximum thickness and percentage wear calculation, which should be avoided.

**Notes to brake failure thickness:**

Brake failure thickness is millimeter thickness threshold at brake failure, which affects brake wear calculation accuracy, and can be customized for specific vehicle class in [Brake Editor](#brake-editor).

For example, if `brake thickness` is `40`mm, and `failure thickness` is `25`mm, then `effective thickness` is `40 - 25 = 15mm`.

Since brake failure thickness threshold data is not available from game API, it may require testing to find out, and may vary from vehicle to vehicle. Front brake failure thickness threshold can be different from rear brake. Thickness threshold value should not exceed brake maximum thickness, otherwise brake wear readings will not be displayed correctly.

Some reference brake failure thickness threshold:
`Hypercar` and `P2` classes in `LMU` usually have `25`mm brake failure threshold.
`GTE` and `LMGT3` class in `LMU` usually has `30`mm brake failure threshold.

## Fuel
**This widget displays fuel usage info.**

Note, for non-hybrid pure electric vehicle, this widget will show `battery charge` usage (in percentage) info instead. Since multiple different electric systems exist in `RF2`, there is no reliable way to distinguish pure electric vehicles from fuel or hybrid vehicles, it is important to make sure `fuel_unit` option in [Units](#units) setting is set to `Liter` in order to correctly display battery charge usage in `percentage` for pure electric vehicles.

---

Differences between `relative` and `absolute` refueling:

* Relative refueling value shows total amount `additional` fuel required to finish the remaining race length, which matches `relative refueling` mechanism (amount to add on top of remaining fuel in tank) in `RF2`.

* Absolute refueling value shows absolute total amount fuel required to finish the remaining race length, which matches `absolute refueling` mechanism (amount total fuel to fill tank up to) in `LMU`.

Also see `estimated laps` display option in [Session](#session) widget that can be used for `absolute refueling`.

---

    show_absolute_refueling
Show absolute refueling value instead of relative refueling when enabled. Note, `+` or `-` sign is not displayed with absolute refueling.

    *remain
Remaining fuel in tank.

    *refuel
Estimated refueling reading, which is the total amount additional fuel required to finish race.

Note, for `relative refueling` (`show_absolute_refueling` disabled), positive value indicates additional refueling and pit-stop would be required, while negative value indicates total remaining fuel at the end of race, and no extra pit-stop required. For example, a `-1.5` value indicates `1.5` remaining fuel after crossed finish line.

For `absolute refueling` (`show_absolute_refueling` enabled), total remaining fuel at the end of race can be found by subtracting `refuel` value from `remain` value. For example, `6` (remain column) - `4.5` (refuel column) = `1.5` remaining fuel after crossed finish line.

    *used
Estimated fuel consumption reading, which is calculated from last-valid-lap fuel consumption and delta fuel consumption. Note, when vehicle is in garage stall, this reading only shows last-valid-lap fuel consumption without delta calculation.

    *delta
Estimated delta fuel consumption reading. Positive value indicates an increase in consumption, while negative indicates a decrease in consumption.

    *pits
Estimate number of pit stop counts when making a pit stop at end of current stint. Any non-zero decimal places would be considered for an additional pit stop.

    *early
Estimate number of pit stop counts when making an early pit stop at end of current lap. This value can be used to determine whether an early pit stop is worth performing comparing to `pits` value.

Example 1: When this value is just below `1.0` (such as `0.97`), it indicates an early pit stop can be made right at the end of current lap with enough empty capacity to refuel according to `refuel` reading which would last to the end of race.

Example 2: When this value is just below `2.0` (such as `1.96`), and `pits` value is also in `1.x` range (such as `1.32`),  it indicates 2 required pit stops, and an early pit stop can be made right at the end of current lap with tank fully refueled according to `refuel` reading. After refueling, `pits` reading would show an approximately `0.96` value which indicates one more required pit stop.

Example 3: If this value is one or more integers higher than `pits` value, then additional pit stops would be required after making a pit stop at the end of current lap.

    *laps
Estimated laps reading that current fuel can last.

    *minutes
Estimated minutes reading that current fuel can last.

    *save
Estimated fuel consumption reading for one less pit stop.

    *end
Estimated remaining fuel reading at the end of current stint before next pit stop, which reflects fuel usage efficiency.

Note, this value does not count towards the end of race; instead, this value always counts towards the end of last completeable lap. To find out total remaining fuel at the end of race, see `refuel` column and explanation.

    bar_width

## Relative finish order
**This widget displays estimated relative finish order between leader and local player with corresponding refilling estimate in a table view.**

**Overview**

This widget predicts `relative final lap progress` (percent into lap) at the moment when session timer ended in time-type race, or leader crossed finish line in laps-type race, which can be used to determine whether extra laps are required to finish race.

Simple example: in time-type race, at the moment when session timer ended, assume race leader's vehicle is in `Sector 1` (or 20% into lap), and local player is in `Sector 3` (or 80% into lap) which is ahead of leader in terms of `relative lap progress` (0% from start line to 100% at finish line). When local player finishes his current lap, the race does not end for him because leader is behind local player and has not yet crossed finish line. This means local player has to complete another lap in order to finish the race, and needs an extra lap of fuel.

---

The table consists of 5 fixed rows, 1 optional row, 3 fixed columns, and 10 optional prediction columns that can be customized. Example:

| TIME |   0s  |  30s  |  40s  |  50s  |  60s  |  54s  |
|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  LDR |  0.49 |  0.20 |  0.11 |  0.02 |  0.92 |  0.98 |
| 0.04 |  0.91 |  0.64 |  0.55 |  0.46 |  0.37 |  0.51 |
| DIFF |   0s  |  30s  |  40s  |  50s  |  60s  |  43s  |
|  NRG | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 |
| EX+1 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 |

First and fourth rows, starting from second cell, show estimated `leader's pit time` and `local player's pit time`, where first row first cell shows current session type in `TIME` or `LAPS`. Last cell shows last recorded total time that leader and local player had spent in pit. Note, last recorded total pit time counts from pit entry to pit exit point, it doesn't include the extra few seconds that spent while approaching or exiting from pit.

Second and third rows, starting from second cell, show estimated `leader's final lap progress` (fraction of lap) and `local player's final lap progress` that depend on current session type:
* For `TIME` type race, it shows final lap progress at the moment when session timer ended.
* For `LAPS` type race, it shows relative final total lap difference between leader and local player.
Leader's value from second row second cell always shows `integer value`, because laps-type race has no timer, and the end of race is determined at the moment when leader crossed finish line, which can only be full laps.
Local player's value from third row second cell always shows final lap progress relative to leader's value from second row second cell.
Both leader's and local player's `final lap progress` values starting from third cell are offset from second cell of same row.

Third row, first cell shows `relative lap difference` between leader and local player that is calculated from lap time pace difference of both players, which can be used to determine whether leader has the chance to overtake local player on final lap. For example:
* If relative lap difference value shows 0.25, that means for every full lap, leader is faster than local player by 0.25 lap. If leader is at start line and player is just within 0.25 lap distance from leader, that means leader can catch up and overtake player before the end of lap.
* If relative lap difference value shows 0.25 and leader is at middle of current lap (0.5 lap), that means leader now only has roughly half of the lap distance (0.12 lap) to make successful overtake before the end of lap. If player is not within this 0.12 lap distance, then leader may not be able to overtake.

Fifth row, first cell shows refilling type in `FUEL` or `NRG` (if virtual energy available). Starting from second cell, shows estimated `local player's refilling` that depends on current session type:
* For `TIME` type race, refilling value from each column is calculated based on local player's current `laptime pace`, `consumption`, and `local player's final lap progress` from third row of same column. Note, each refilling value has no relation to `leader's final lap progress` value from same column. Refilling value from `0s` column gives same reading as seen from `Fuel` or `Virtual Energy` Widget in time-type race.
* For `LAPS` type race, only refilling value from `0s` column is calculated and displayed according to leader's `leader's final lap progress` value.
Other column values are not displayed, this is done to avoid confusion. Because unlike `TIME` type race where all `final lap progress` values are within `0.0` to `1.0` range, in `LAPS` type race values can exceed `1.0` or below `0.0` (negative), which the number of possible lap differences would increase exponentially and not possible to list all of them in the widget.

Sixth row (optional), first cell shows `number of extra laps` for extra refilling display. Starting from second cell, shows estimated `extra refilling` value that depends on `local player's refilling` value and `number of extra laps` setting. Each extra refilling value equals `extra laps of consumption` plus `local player's refilling` value of same column. Those values save the trouble from manual calculation in case there will be extra laps.

See `TIME` or `LAPS` type race example usages below for details.

**Important notes**

* Prediction accuracy depends on many variables and is meant for final stint estimate. Such as laptime pace, pit time, penalties, weather condition, safety car, yellow flag, can all affect prediction accuracy. It requires at least 2-3 laps to get sensible readings, and more laps to have better accuracy.

* `Final lap progress` values will not be displayed if no corresponding valid lap time pace data found, which requires at least 1 or 2 laps to record. If local player is the leader, then all values from leader's row will not be displayed. Refilling values will not be displayed during formation lap for the reasons mentioned in first note.

* Refilling estimate calculation is different between `TIME` and `LAPS` type races, make sure to look at the correct value, check out `example usage` below for details.

* `LMU` currently uses `absolute refueling` mechanism (amount `total` fuel to fill tank up to), as opposite to relative fuel (amount to `add` on top of remaining fuel in tank). User can enabled `show_absolute_refilling` option to display total amount fuel/energy required (including fuel/energy in tank) to finish race.

**Time-type race example usage**

| TIME | 0s   | 30s  | 40s  | 50s  | 60s  | 0s   |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| LDR  | 0.38 | 0.10 | 0.01 | 0.91 | 0.82 | 0.38 |
| 0.11 | 0.72 | 0.47 | 0.39 | 0.31 | 0.22 | 0.37 |
| DIFF | 0s   | 30s  | 40s  | 50s  | 60s  | 43s  |
| FUEL | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 |
| EX+1 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 |

1. Determine leader's next pit time and select `leader's final lap progress` (second row) value from corresponding pit time (first row) column. `0s` column means no pit stop.

2. Determine local player's next pit time and select `local player's final lap progress` (third row) value from corresponding pit time (fourth row) column.

3. Compare the two `final lap progress` values from leader and local player, assume fuel per lap is `3.8`:

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is greater than local player, such as leader's 0.91 (50s column) vs player's 0.47 (30s column), it indicates that leader will be ahead of local player when timer ended, and there will be no extra final lap. So `local player's refilling` value from corresponding `30s` column can be used, in this case, it's `+7.4` fuel to add.
    However, if leader is closer to finish line (as show in orange color indicator), there is a chance that leader may be fast enough to cross finish line before the end of timer, which would result an extra final lap for local player, and requires adding an extra lap of fuel (`3.8`) on top of `+7.4` fuel. In this case it would be `+11.2` refuel, or you can simply look at the refuel value from `extra refilling row` of same column.

    * If local player's `final lap progress` value is greater than leader, such as leader's 0.10 (30s column) vs player's 0.39 (40s column), it indicates that local player will be ahead of leader when timer ended, and there will be an extra final lap for local player, and here again requires adding an extra lap of fuel (`3.8`) on top of `+7.4` fuel from `40s` column, which is `+11.2` refuel.
    However, if the difference between the two `final lap progress` values is smaller than `relative lap difference` (from third row first cell) value, it may indicate that leader could overtake local player on final lap, which would result no extra final lap.

4. To sum up, if comparison shows no extra final lap, then just refill according to `local player's refilling` (fifth row) value from the same column of `local player's final lap progress` (third row). If comparison shows an extra final lap, then just add an extra lap of fuel on top of `local player's refilling` value; or, just look at the refuel value from `extra refilling row` of same column.


**Laps-type race example usage**

Note, there is generally no reason to use this widget in `LAPS` type race unless you are doing multi-class laps-type race which is very rarely seen.

| LAPS | 0s    | 30s  | 40s   | 50s   | 60s   | 0s   |
|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
| LDR  | 2.00  | 1.57 | 1.43  | 1.28  | 1.14  | 2.00 |
| 0.11 | 0.40  | 0.02 | -0.11 | -0.24 | -0.37 | 0.40 |
| DIFF | 0s    | 30s  | 40s   | 50s   | 60s   | 43s  |
| FUEL | +12.8 | -    | -     | -     | -     | -    |
| EX+1 | +15.0 | -    | -     | -     | -     | -    |

1. Determine leader's next pit time and select `leader's final lap progress` (second row) value from corresponding pit time (first row) column. `0s` means no pit stop.

2. Determine local player's next pit time and select `local player's final lap progress` (third row) value from corresponding pit time (fourth row) column.

3. Subtract `local player's final lap progress` value from `leader's final lap progress`, then round down value:

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is 2.00 (0s column), and local player's `final lap progress` value is 0.40 (0s column), then after subtracting (2 - 0.4 = 1.6) and rounding down, the final value is `1` lap difference, which means local player will do `one less lap` than leader.
    As mentioned earlier, for laps-type race, refilling value from `0s column` is calculated according to leader's `leader's final lap progress` value, which any lap difference is already included in the result from `local player's refilling` value (fifth row second cell), in this case, it's `+12.8` fuel to add.

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is 1.43 (40s column), and local player's `final lap progress` value is -0.24 (50s column), then after subtracting (1.43 - -0.24 = 1.67) and rounding down, the final value is also `1` lap difference, which means local player will do the same `one less lap` than leader. So in this case, it's still `+12.8` fuel to add.

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is 2.00 (0s column), and local player's `final lap progress` value is -0.11 (40s column), then after subtracting (2 - -0.11 = 2.11) and rounding down, the final value is `2` lap difference, which means local player will do `two less laps` than leader. So an extra lap of fuel may be removed from `local player's refilling` value from fifth row second cell, in this case, it's `12.8` minus one lap of fuel `2.2`, equals `+10.6` fuel to add. Alternatively, it can be calculated from full lap refuel (as show in Fuel Widget), which will be `15.0` minus two lap of fuel `4.4`, and equals `+10.6` fuel to add.
    Be aware that carrying less fuel is risky in laps-type race due to reasons below.

4. Last note, since the end of laps-type race is determined by the moment that leader completed all race laps, leader can greatly affect final prediction outcome. To give an extreme example, if leader is ahead of everyone by a few laps, and decides to wait a few minutes on his final lap before finish line, then everyone else will be catching up and do a few `extra laps` which would require more fuel. Thus it is always risky to carry less fuel in laps-type race.

    show_best_laptime
Show driver's session best lap time.

    show_delta_laptime
Show lap time difference (delta) between player and opponents from most recent laps (up to 5 recent lap time records). The default layout order shows delta lap time records from right side column (most recent lap) to left.

A green color (default) delta indicates that player's recent lap time is faster than opponent, while orange color delta indicates the opposite.

    show_inverted_delta_laptime_layout
Enable this option to invert layout order for delta lap time records.

    number_of_delta_laptime
Set number of delta lap time records to display. Minimum number is limited to `2`, maximum is limited to `5`.

    show_energy_remaining
Show remaining virtual energy reading in percentage from each driver, with 4 different states:
- Unavailable: virtual energy reading is not available currently, default color grey.
- High: above 30% remaining, default color green.
- low: from 30% to 10% remaining, default color orange.
- critical: 10% or lower remaining, default color red.

**Known limitation with remaining virtual energy readings**

Currently, remaining virtual energy data from `LMU's Rest API` is updated only when driver completes a lap, which means the data from API will not change during a lap, but only at the moment a lap is done by a driver. And due to this, the data will not tell how much energy was refilled in pit until the driver finished his pit out lap. This makes the data less useful by itself.

To workaround this API limitation, a special interpolation algorithm is implemented, which enables accurate estimates to remaining energy progressively during a lap for each driver. The average accuracy of estimation is within 1%.

Some cases where interpolation may not be applied:
- Interpolation may require at least 1 full lap (not counting pit out lap) done before it can take effect.
- During pit stop, refilled energy reading may not be updated until driver finishes his pit out lap (as mentioned earlier), which means old energy reading persists during pit out lap and would result wrong estimates with interpolation. For this reason, interpolation is disabled during pit out lap.

In either case, just wait another lap and energy readings will be synchronized.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Track map
**This widget displays track map and standings. Note: at least one complete and valid lap is required to generate track map.**

    display_orientation
Set track map display orientation in degrees. For example, a `270` value will rotate map by `270` degrees clockwise. Default value is `0`, which always displays track map `North Up` in game's coordinate system.

    display_detail_level
Sets detail level for track map. Default value is `1`, which auto adjusts map detail according to display size. Higher value reduces map detail and RAM usage, and may also help reduce rough edges from large map. Set to `0` for full detail.

Set area display size.

    area_margin
Set area margin size.

    show_background
Show widget background.

    show_map_background
Show background of the inner map area. This option only works for circular type tracks.

    map_width
Set track map line width.

    map_outline_width
Set track map outline width.

    show_start_line
Show start line mark.

    show_sector_line
Show sector line mark.

    show_vehicle_standings
Show vehicle standings info on track map. Note, if `enable_multi_class_styling` is enabled, position in class will be displayed for each vehicle class instead.

    enable_multi_class_styling
Show vehicles in multi-class color styles on map instead. Multi-class color can be customized from [Vehicle Class Editor](#vehicle-class-editor).

Note, while multi-class styling is enabled, following color styles will not be displayed:
`vehicle_color_player`, `vehicle_color_leader`, `vehicle_color_same_lap`, `vehicle_color_laps_ahead`, `vehicle_color_laps_behind`.

    show_position_in_class
Show position in class while `enable_multi_class_styling` option is also enabled, otherwise this option has no effect.

    show_lap_difference_outline
Show outline color based on lap difference (ahead or behind) between player and opponents. This option is disabled by default.

    show_pitout_prediction
Show estimated pit out on-track position indication for each pit stop duration. Default indication shows `circle` with `pit stop duration` displayed above.

Note, pit out position prediction is based on `delta best` data which scaled with player's latest `lap time pace` for accurate real-time position prediction under various track conditions. Pit out prediction requires both valid `track map` and `delta best` data to display. At least `one valid lap` for any car and track combo is required to display pit out prediction.

For accurate prediction, the location of `pit out line` must be found first. And since each track has different pit out line location, it is required to `pit out` at least `once per session` to mark the correct pit out line location. This can be easily done by driving out of pit lane.

    show_pitout_prediction_while_requested_pitstop
Show estimated pit out on-track position indication while player has requested pitstop and not in pit lane.

    number_of_prediction
Set number of pit out prediction to display. Value range is limited in `1` to `20`.

    pitstop_duration_minimum
Set pit stop duration (in seconds) of first prediction.

    pitstop_duration_increment
Set each pit stop duration (in seconds) increment after previous prediction. Default increment is `10` seconds.

Note, each time when pit stop duration of the nearest prediction exceeded current pit stop timer, the prediction circle will be removed, and a new prediction circle will be appended with pit stop duration increment after the last prediction.

    pitout_time_offset
Set amount time offset (in seconds) for catching up with vehicle speed after pit out. Default is `3` seconds.

Note, this value is important for accurate prediction, as initial vehicle speed is much slower after pit out, so extra time is needed for driver to catch up, and also affected by pit out line location. For most tracks, this extra time after pit out is roughly within `1` to `5` seconds.

    show_pitstop_duration
Show pit stop duration reading on top of each prediction circle.

## Virtual energy
**This widget displays virtual energy usage info.**

Note, most options are inherited from [Fuel](#fuel) widget, with some additions noted below. For battery charge usage info, see [Battery](#battery) widget.

    show_absolute_refilling
Show absolute refilling value instead of relative refilling when enabled. Note, `+` or `-` sign is not displayed with absolute refilling.

    *ratio
Show fuel ratio between estimated fuel and energy consumption, which can help balance fuel and energy usage, as well as providing refueling reference for adjusting pit stop `Fuel ratio` during race.

    *bias
Show fuel bias (unit in laps) that calculated from estimated laps difference between fuel and virtual energy.

Positive value indicates more laps can be run on fuel than virtual energy; in other words, virtual energy will deplete sooner than fuel. For example, a value of `+1.5` indicates that there will be `1.5 laps` of extra fuel remaining after virtual energy depleted.

Note, depleting virtual energy could result a `Stop-Go` penalty in `LMU`; while running out of fuel means no power for vehicle and would result retirement from race. So it is a good idea to keep fuel bias close to `0.0`, and slightly towards positive side to avoid depleting fuel before virtual energy.
